### Marks
During the practice (lab) sessions you will get 5 little exams, that can give you 2 points each. (10 points in total.) After the 6th week we will have a sort Lab exame, where you will have to write some code for 5 points, and answer some questions to measure your lexical knowledge for 5 points. (The exam grants 5+5 = 10 points as well.) So alltogether you can get 20 points during the 6 weeks, which can be exchanged to marks as this:

    0 - 9: 1
